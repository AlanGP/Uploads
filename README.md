# Other Peoples Work

This is borrowed code and documents that have been freely made available on the internet.

It is stored against the possibility of the original soure disappearing.

I ask that viewers respect the rights of authors whose work is stored here.

I will annotate work that might require the originators permission but this site will only hold work that has been made publically available i.e. uTube videos or other internet locations.
