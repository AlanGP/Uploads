# Master
Final location for random original and borrowed code.

Although I am happy for any of my original work to be used under the GNU General Licence associated with this site, that does not indicate a general free for all with other authors work, unless they too are supporting the GNU General Licence. Unfortunately, I cannot budget for the cost of making this Github private.

I ask that viewers respect the rights of authors whose work is stored here.

I will annotate work that might require the originators permission but this site will only hold work that has been made publically available i.e. uTube videos or other internet locations.
